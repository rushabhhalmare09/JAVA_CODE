git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push origin master 
           --------- origin master
                       --> It is nothing but our branch  
                       --> here origin is constant, but aftrer origin we can type anything example master origin master2 origin temp2, basically this tells us in which branch our code is being pushed



============
When we push our code to Github, the name and source from where the code is pushed, it is saved in config file which we can access from "git config --global --edit" command, we will get our local machine details.

    our configuration file:

       git config --global --edit

   After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:
 
       git commit --amend --reset-author
