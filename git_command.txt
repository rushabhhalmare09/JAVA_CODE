GIT

1] To upload in existing Repos

  git clone HTTPS//:git  --URL from your repo
  git status
  git add .    --- or --- git add filename
  git commit -m "Added new feature"
  git push origin master 
           ----- origin master
                     --> It is nothing but our branch  
                     --> here origin is constant, but aftrer origin we can type anything example master origin master2 origin temp2, basically this tells us in which branch our code is being pushed

2]Initialize a Local Repositor and upload in data

  Go to path
  git init
  git add . or git add filename
  git commit -m "Added new feature"  
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
  git push -u origin master


============
When we push our code to Github, the name and source from where the code is pushed, it is saved in config file which we can access from "git config --global --edit" command, we will get our local machine details.

    our configuration file:

       git config --global --edit

   After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:
 
       git commit --amend --reset-author
