HTTP Overview

HTTP Caching

TCP: -
Transmission Control Protocol
Based on connections (involves 3-way handshake)
Guaranteed delivery of packets
Flow/Congestion control
'TCP Fast Open' improves connection times
Good for sites, applications etc.

UDP: -
User Datagram Protocol
Delivery not guaranteed
Stateless, not connection based
Doesn't support ordering (to be handled by application)
Good for games, videos etc.
HTTP Verbs
HEAD, OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

HTTP Caching: -
ETag: Fingerprint of the resource (eg: MD5 checksum), to indicate if resource is changed.
no-cache: Cache but use only after re-validating if resource is updated.
no-store: Do not cache, and re-download for each request.
max-age: Amount in seconds the resource can be cached.
must-revalidate, max-age:30: Re-use cache for 30 seconds, after that must revalidate. (This can avoid download if resource has not been changed even after 30 seconds)
Ideal: Have html pages as no-cache, and rename all other resources with unique file name (like md5 checksum of the file).

HTTP Statuses: -
200: Ok
400: Bad request
401: Not authenticated
403: Not authorized
404: Not found
500: Internal server error
HTTP Statuses in a nutshell
20x: Success
30x: Redirection
40x: Client Error
50x: Server Error

HTTP 2: - 
Why?: Top sites average 100 requests per page. Browsers allow max 6 connections. Min 35ms round trip per request. 80 byte header.
No head of line blocking.
Binary
Header compression. Does not send repeated headers.
Priority based
Prefetch
Server Push

HTTPS (TLS): -
Transport Layer Security
Server port 443
Certificate: Public-Private key. Signed by Certificate Authority (Verisign, Symantec, Thawte etc). These well known CAs are shipped and managed by the browser.
Additional handshake on top of TCP
