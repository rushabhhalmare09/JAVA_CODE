Q1.vWhat is the difference between Compiler and Interpreter

* The differences between Compiler and Interpreter are as follows:

1.
A compiler is a software program which is used to compile the source code which is in (High Level Language) as an input at once and translates it into the Lower Level Language in (byte code or MLL) like in java it will translate to byte code (.class file) and then that byte code is given to JVM which has JIT compiler and at runtime it will translate to native machine code and during the compilation process if any errors exists it will show all that error after the compilation is over.

Whereas, Interpreter is also a software program which is used to check and execute the code line by line and if in any particular line error is found then it will stop the execution there and we need to do the corrections and then interpreter starts again checking from the start.


2.
Compiler will take less time compare to Interpreter because when we compile a source code the compiler at once compiles the code and prompt us with all the  errors that may exist in that code  at once also if compiler compiled the code successfully recompilation in future is not needed (which saves our time) as in terms of java the byte code which has been generated by compiler(javac) can be given to JVM for translating into MLL and thus executing the program.

Whereas, Interpreter will take more time as it will check and execute the source code(HLL) line by line and if any error occurs it halts there and the programmer needs to fix the error then Interpreter starts scanning from the start again (which consumes more time).

Q2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

* The differences between JDK, JRE and JVM are as follows:

JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is used for Java application development. It includes tools such as the Java compiler (javac) for compiling Java source code into bytecode, the Java debugger (jdb) for debugging, and various libraries for different functionalities. It provides all the necessary tools and resources needed to develop Java applications.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE is a runtime environment required to run Java applications. It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which interprets and executes Java bytecode. The JRE also provides necessary runtime libraries and resources needed for the execution of Java applications. It does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing it on the underlying hardware or operating system. The JVM also includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which dynamically compiles parts of the bytecode into native machine code for improved performance during runtime.

Q3. How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?

1) Method Area: It contains the class structures, method information and class variables(a.k.a static variables).
2) Java Stack: It contains the local variables, method parameters and arguments , return addresses and the computation results. Each thread in java has its own Stack.
3) Heap: It provides Dynamic memory to store objects in Heap memory(run-time data memory) where objects are created during the execution of program. It is created when we use new keyword. Heap is a shared memory area accessible to all the Threads runnimg within JVM.
4) PC Register: It hold the address of the currently executing JVM instruction. Pc register also called as Instruction pointer which keeps tracks of the currenlty executing JVM instruction and points to the next instruction to be executed by JVM. It also helps in handle the program flow. It also helps in management of exception handling when an error occurs 	by determining the approprite Exception handler to execute based on the current instruction pointer.
5) Native Method stack: The Native Method Stack is a dedicated memory area within the JVM for executing native methods. It provides separate stack frames and local variable storage for native code, allowing it to interface with the JVM and access system resources outside the Java environment.

Q4. What is JIT compiler?

JIT stands for Just-in-time compiler which is a component of JVM. JIT compiler in the JVM works alongside the interpreter to dynamically analyze, optimize, and compile hot spots(frequently executed portions of code) of the code into native machine code. This optimization process enhances the execution speed of the Java program.

Q5. What are the various access specifiers in Java?

1) Public:    Accessible from any class or package
2) Protected: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
3) Default:   Accessible within the same package
4) Private:   Accessible only within the same class

* These access specifiers help enforce encapsulation and control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

Q6.What is a compiler in Java?

The compiler in Java, such as the javac compiler, converts high-level Java source code into bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the program. The bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which may further optimize it using a JIT compiler.
