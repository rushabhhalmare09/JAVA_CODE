Q1.vWhat is the difference between Compiler and Interpreter

* The differences between Compiler and Interpreter are as follows:

1.
A compiler is a software program which is used to compile the source code which is in (High Level Language) as an input at once and translates it into the Lower Level Language in (byte code or MLL) like in java it will translate to byte code (.class file) and then that byte code is given to JVM which has JIT compiler and at runtime it will translate to native machine code and during the compilation process if any errors exists it will show all that error after the compilation is over.

Whereas, Interpreter is also a software program which is used to check and execute the code line by line and if in any particular line error is found then it will stop the execution there and we need to do the corrections and then interpreter starts again checking from the start.


2.
Compiler will take less time compare to Interpreter because when we compile a source code the compiler at once compiles the code and prompt us with all the  errors that may exist in that code  at once also if compiler compiled the code successfully recompilation in future is not needed (which saves our time) as in terms of java the byte code which has been generated by compiler(javac) can be given to JVM for translating into MLL and thus executing the program.

Whereas, Interpreter will take more time as it will check and execute the source code(HLL) line by line and if any error occurs it halts there and the programmer needs to fix the error then Interpreter starts scanning from the start again (which consumes more time).

Q2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

* The differences between JDK, JRE and JVM are as follows:

JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is used for Java application development. It includes tools such as the Java compiler (javac) for compiling Java source code into bytecode, the Java debugger (jdb) for debugging, and various libraries for different functionalities. It provides all the necessary tools and resources needed to develop Java applications.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE is a runtime environment required to run Java applications. It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which interprets and executes Java bytecode. The JRE also provides necessary runtime libraries and resources needed for the execution of Java applications. It does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing it on the underlying hardware or operating system. The JVM also includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which dynamically compiles parts of the bytecode into native machine code for improved performance during runtime.

Q3. How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?

1) Method Area: It contains the class structures, method information and class variables(a.k.a static variables).
2) Java Stack: It contains the local variables, method parameters and arguments , return addresses and the computation results. Each thread in java has its own Stack.
3) Heap: It provides Dynamic memory to store objects in Heap memory(run-time data memory) where objects are created during the execution of program. It is created when we use new keyword. Heap is a shared memory area accessible to all the Threads runnimg within JVM.
4) PC Register: It hold the address of the currently executing JVM instruction. Pc register also called as Instruction pointer which keeps tracks of the currenlty executing JVM instruction and points to the next instruction to be executed by JVM. It also helps in handle the program flow. It also helps in management of exception handling when an error occurs 	by determining the approprite Exception handler to execute based on the current instruction pointer.
5) Native Method stack: The Native Method Stack is a dedicated memory area within the JVM for executing native methods. It provides separate stack frames and local variable storage for native code, allowing it to interface with the JVM and access system resources outside the Java environment.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q4. What is JIT compiler?

JIT stands for Just-in-time compiler which is a component of JVM. JIT compiler in the JVM works alongside the interpreter to dynamically analyze, optimize, and compile hot spots(frequently executed portions of code) of the code into native machine code. This optimization process enhances the execution speed of the Java program.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q5. What are the various access specifiers in Java?

1) Public:    Accessible from any class or package
2) Protected: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
3) Default:   Accessible within the same package
4) Private:   Accessible only within the same class

* These access specifiers help enforce encapsulation and control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q6.What is a compiler in Java?

The compiler in Java, such as the javac compiler, converts high-level Java source code into bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the program. The bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which may further optimize it using a JIT compiler.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q7. Explain the types of variables in Java?

Types of variables in java:

Local Variables: Local variables are declared within a method or block, have limited scope, and hold temporary values for the duration of the block's execution.

Instance Variables: Instance variables are declared within a class, each instance of the class has its own copy, they hold values associated with the object's state, and exist as long as the object exists.

Class Variables: Class variables are declared with the static keyword, associated with the class itself rather than instances, shared among all instances of the class, and retain their values throughout the program's execution.

Parameters: Parameters are declared in method or constructor signatures, receive values passed during invocation, behave like local variables within the method or constructor, and have scope limited to the respective method or constructor.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q8. What are the Datatypes in Java?

There are two types of Datatypes in Java:
1) Primitive Datatypes (built-in dtattype)
- byte: 1 byte
- short: 8 byte
- int: 32bit
- char: 2 byte
- long: 8 byte
- float: 4 byte
- double: 8 byte
- boolean: True or False

2) Non-primitive (Reference Data Types):

- class: A reference to an object of a class.
- interface: A reference to an interface type.
- array: A reference to an array object.
- enum: A reference to an enumerated type.
- String: A sequence of characters

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q9. What are the identifiers in java?

- identifer is a name in java program.
- identifer can be classname,methodname,variablename,labelname.

Eg:

class Demo
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    int x = 10;
  }
}


Demo: classname
main: methodName
String: className
args : variablename
x : variableName

Note: The only character allowed for java identifiers is a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $, _

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q10. Explain the architecture of JVM 


- Class Loader Subsystem: Loads Java class files into memory from various sources.

- Runtime Data Areas: Includes the method area, heap, Java stack, and PC register to store class-level data, objects, method frames, and execution information.

- Execution Engine: Interprets bytecode or dynamically compiles it to native code using a JIT compiler for efficient execution.

- Garbage Collector: Manages memory by reclaiming unused objects in the heap through automatic garbage collection.

- Native Method Interface (JNI): Enables interaction between Java code and native code written in other languages.

These components work together to provide platform independence, memory management, bytecode interpretation/compilation, and integration with native code in the JVM.

Q1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?


In Java, there are several conditional operators used for making decisions and performing conditional evaluations.

1) Equality Operators:
   == Checks for equality between two values.
   != Checks for inequality between two values.

2. Relational Operators:
   < Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
   > Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
   < Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
   > Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
   >=, <= 

3. Conditional Operators:
   && (Logical AND): Performs a conditional AND operation.
   || (Logical OR): Performs a conditional OR operation.

4. Ternary Operator:
   ? : Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on the condition.
   Ex: (2>4) ? "yes" : "false"; //output: false

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?

1) Unary Operator:
-Unary operators work with a single operand.

-Examples include unary plus (+), unary minus (-), increment (++), decrement (--), logical complement (!), and bitwise complement (~).
Binary Operators:

2) Binary Operator: 
- Binary operators work with two operands.

- Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), logical operators (&&, ||), and assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).

3) Ternary Operator:
- The ternary operator is the only operator that takes three operands.

-It is represented as "condition ? expression1 : expression2" and is used for making decisions based on a condition.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q3.What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?

The switch case statement in Java is used to control program flow based on multiple possible values of a variable. It provides a concise and efficient way to handle different cases, improving code readability and maintainability by avoiding repetitive if-else statements.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q4.What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?

There are 3 types of conditional Statements:

1) if statement: It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

2) if-else statement: It extends the if statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false. If the condition is true, the if block is executed; otherwise, the else block is execute

3) switch case: It allows for multiple branching based on different values of a variable or expression. It compares the value of the variable against different case labels and executes the corresponding block of code.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q5.What is the syntax of if else statement?

if(boolean condition){
   //body
}
else{
}

* It True if block will be executed or False then else block will be executed.

Q6.How do you compare two strings in Java?
In Java, you can compare two strings using the equals() method to check for content equality or the compareTo() method to compare lexicographically. equals() is case-sensitive, while compareTo() returns an integer indicating the relationship between the strings.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q7. What is Mutable String in Java Explain with an example?


In Java, a mutable string refers to a string that can be modified after it is created. The standard String class in Java is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed once it is assigned. However, StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes provide mutable string implementations.

1) String Buffer

- StringBuffer is a mutable string class in Java. It provides various methods to modify the string, such as append(), delete(), insert(), replace(), and more. These methods enable you to change the length and content of the string.

eg:: StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("sachinrameshtendulkar");
     sb.delete(6,12);
     System.out.println(sb);//sachintendulkar
     sb.deleteCharAt(13);
     System.out.println(sb);//sachintndulkar
     
     * It is Thread safe.
     
2) String Builder

- StringBuilder is similar to StringBuffer and provides the same set of methods for modifying strings. It is also a mutable string class, but unlike StringBuffer, it is not thread-safe.

eg:: StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("sachinrameshtendulkar");
     sb.delete(6,12);
     System.out.println(sb);//sachintendulkar
     sb.deleteCharAt(13);
     System.out.println(sb);//sachintndulkar
     
* The key difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is their thread-safety behavior, with StringBuffer being thread-safe and StringBuilder being more efficient but non-thread-safe.

Q8. Write a program to sort a String Alphabetically

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Test1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "ineuron";
        char[] ch = str.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(ch);
        String sorted = new String(ch);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("Sorted String: " + sorted);
    }
}

Q9.Write a program to check if the letter 'e' is present in the word 'Umbrella'?

public class LetterCheckExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "Umbrella";
        boolean isPresent = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == 'e') {
                isPresent = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isPresent) {
            System.out.println("The letter 'e' is present in the word 'Umbrella'.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The letter 'e' is not present in the word 'Umbrella'.");
        }
    }
}

Q10.Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?

String Constant Pool is a concept related to the storage of string literals in Java, and its location has evolved over different versions of the JVM:

Prior to Java 7: 
________________

The SCP was indeed a part of the Java heap memory. String literals and other interned strings were stored in the heap memory alongside other objects.

Java 7 and Java 8:
__________________

The SCP was moved out of the heap memory and became a part of the "permanent generation" (permgen) space. The permgen space was a separate area within the JVM's non-heap memory.

Java 8 and later:
_________________

The concept of permgen was replaced by the "Metaspace," which is also a part of the non-heap memory. Class metadata, including the SCP, is stored in the Metaspace.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________






Other reference:
________________

String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = new String("Hello").intern();

The line String str1 = "Hello"; creates a string literal "Hello" in the String Constant Pool (SCP). String literals are automatically interned by the JVM, so when you assign "Hello" to str1, it refers to the interned string object in the SCP.

The line String str2 = new String("Hello").intern(); creates a new string object using the new keyword, which allocates memory in the heap for the string. However, the subsequent call to intern() returns a reference to the interned string object in the SCP if it already exists. So in this case, str2 will refer to the same interned "Hello" string object in the SCP rather than creating a new one in the heap.

* This demonstrates how using the intern() method  helps optimize memory usage by avoiding the creation of duplicate string objects.

Q6. What is the benefit of encapsulation in java?

- In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), data and associated behavior forms a single unit, which is referred to as a class. The term encapsulation refers to combining data and associated functions as a single unit. 

- Encapsulation is the technique of making the field in a class private and providing access to those fields using getter and setter methods.

- To hide the internal implementation details of the class.


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q7.Is java a 100% Object oriented Programming language? If no why ?

No, java is not 100% Object oriented programming language. Because it support primtive datatypes (like byte,short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean) which is not Object Type. Inspite of that java also have wrapper classes via which we can craete object of all primitive datatypes.

Q8. What are the advantages of abstraction in java?


Advantages of Abstarction is following:
_______________________________________

1) It reduces the complexity of viewing things.
2) Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
3) Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only essential details are provided to the user.
4) It improves the maintainability of the application. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q9. What is an abstraction explained with an Example?

Abstraction is one of the main Pillar of OOP. It is mechanism displays or show us only relevant state and behaviour of object and hides the unnecessary details about it.

Ex:
___

when we are driving a car, we are only concerned about driving the car like start/stop the car, accelerate, break, etc. We are not concerned about how the actual start/stop mechanism or accelerate/brake process works internally.  We are just not interested in those details.


//abstract class
abstract class Car{  
    abstract void accelerate();  
}
  
//concrete class
class Suzuki extends Car{  
    void accelerate(){
        System.out.println("Suzuki::accelerate");
     
    }
}


class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Car obj = new Suzuki();  
        obj.accelerate();       
    }   
}  

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Q10. What is the final class in Java?

- A final is a keyword can be used with class, variable and method name.

- A final keyword is also used to make a variable as constant once var value is declared constant the value can't be changed later.

- If a method is made as final the subclass can inherit the method but cannot override.

- If a class is made as final then we can't extend that class.
