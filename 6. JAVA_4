Arrays and Strings
++++++++++++++++++
 1. Need of arrays
 2. Array declaration
 3. Array construction
 4. Array initialization
 5. Array declaration,construction,intialization in single line.
 6. length vs length() method
 7. Anaonmyous arrays
 8. Array element assignments
 9. Array variable assignments.
Why do we need arrays?
 => Single variable can hold only value at a time, if we want to store many values 
then we need to store them
 in mulitple variables.
 => Mulitple variable will hold mulitple values, but remembering the variable names
to get the data back becomes headache for
 the programmer.
 => To resovle this problem we need to go for "Arrays".

Array declaration
+++++++++++++++++
 Single dimension array
int[] a; //prefered
int a[];
 Two dimension array
int[][] a;//prefered
int [][]a;
int a[][];
int[] [] a;
int[] a[];
int []a[];
 Three dimension array
 int[][][] a;
int [][][]a;
int a[][][];
int [] [][]a;
int [] a[][];
int [] []a[];
int [][] a[];
int []a[] [];
Which of the following are valid and mention the dimension?
 int[] a,b; ===> valid[a-1d,b-1d]
 int[] a[],b; ===> valid[a-2d,b-1d]
 int[] []a,b; ===> valid[a-2d,b-2d]
 int[] a,[]b; ===> invalid
 int[3] a; ====> invalid
Note: if we want to specify the dimension before the variable, that rule is 
applicable only for 1st variable, from second variable
 onwards it is not applicable, if we try to it would result in "CompileTime" 
Error.
 While declaring an array, we can't specify the size, if we try to do so it 
would result in "CommpileTime" Error.
+++++++++++++++++
ArrayConstruction
+++++++++++++++++
 int a[];
 int a[] =new int[3];
=> In java arrays are treated as objects, so using new keyword we need to construct
and array.
=> For every array type corresponding classes are available.
=> These classes are part of java language and it would not be available to 
"programmer"
=> These classes would be avaiable at the run time so we say these classes as 
"Proxy classes".
ArrayType Corresponding class
 int[] [I 
 byte[] [B
 boolean[] [Z
Note::
class names are treated as an "identifers".
Rules for naming an identifer
a. symbols allowed(a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, _ and $]
=> Whenever we print reference variable,internally jvm calls toString() on that 
variable and prints the "hashcode" value.
=> int a= 10; //primitive variable
=> Student s= new Student();
 System.out.println(s);//s.toString()
++++++++
Snippets
++++++++
=> int[] a = new int[]; //CE
=> int[] a = new int[0]; 
 System.out.println(a[0]);//RE:: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 System.out.println(a.length);//0
=> int[] a = new int[-3]; //RE:NegativeArraySizeException
 System.out.println(a[0]);
 System.out.println(a.length);
=> int[] a =new int['a']; //valid
 byte b= 10;
 int[] a =new int[b]; //valid
 short s = 20;
 int [] a =new int[s]; //valid
 int[] a = new int[10L];//CE
 int[] a = new int[10.5];//CE
-> Integer a =new Integer(10);
 int[] b = new int[a.MAX_VALUE];
 int[] c = new int[a.MAX_VALUE + 1];//RE: OutOfMemoryError[heapmemory is full]
How multiDimension Arrays in java are implemented?
 => Array of arrays,it is not in matirx form.
 => Advantage is memory utilization
++++++++
example
++++++++
 2-D => 1-D + 1-D
 3-D => 2-D + 1-D
eg#1.
 int[][] a =new int[2][];//JaggedArray
 a[0] = new int[2];
 a[1] = new int[3];
eg#2.
 int[][] a =new int[2][3];//Homogeneous array
++++++++++++++++++++++
usecase of JaggedArray
+++++++++++++++++++++++
=> Store the information of students belonging to 8th sem which has 3 sections, A->
50, B->35, C -> 51
int[][] a = new int[3][];
 a[0] =new int[50];
 a[1] =new int[35];
 a[2] =new int[51];
Which of the following declarations are valid?
 int[] a = new int[]; //invalid
 int[][] a = new int[3][];//valid
 int[][] a = new int[][4];//invalid
 int[][][] a =new int[3][][];//valid
 int[][][] a =new int[][4][];//invalid
